# Python Projects

### 1. Stock Market Strategy learner
##### Develop an ML based stock market strategy learner to defeat a benchmark
- use three different stock market indicators
- Develop a manual startegy that perfroms better than the benchmrk
- Develop a strategy learner that can learn a trading policy using a tree based bag-learner and the selcted stock market indicators to beat a benchmark strategy
- Asses perfromance against the benchmark and the developed manual startegy
