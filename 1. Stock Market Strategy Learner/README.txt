Before you run the code, please make sure the ml4t environment is activated in the virtual machine. In addition to that, please make sure the util.py is in the current working directory and the 'Data' folder is in the parent directory. You will need the following scripts in the current directory to generate the plots (in .png format):

1. testproject.py: This file generates all the plots and data necessary for the report submitted for this project. You need to execute the command: python3 testproject.py
2. experiment1.py: This file is an implementation of experiment 1. You need to execute the command: python3 experiment1.py. This will generate all the plots and data required for the experiment 1 of this project.
2. experiment2.py: This file is an implementation of experiment 1. You need to execute the command: python3 experiment2.py. This will generate all the plots and data required for the experiment 2 of this project.
3. ManualStrategy.py: This file is an implementation of the indicator based Manual Strategy. You need to execute the command: python3 TManualStrategy.py. This will generate the plot and the statistics presented in the report for this strategy. 	
4. StrategyLearner.py : This file is an implementation of the Machine Learning based strategy learner. You do not need to separately run this code run this code.
5. indicators.py: This file is an implementation of the 3 stock market indicators picked up from the five indicators presented in project 6. You do not need to run this code.
6. marketsimcode.py : An improved version of our marketsim code that was developed in project 5 that accepts a “trades” DataFrame (instead of a file). You do not need to run this code.
7. RTLearner.py : Implementation of the Random Tree Learner (slightly modified version from project 3). You do not need to run this code.
8. BagLearner.py : Implementation of the Bag Learner (slightly modified version from project 3). You do not need to run this code.
